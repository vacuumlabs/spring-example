# Spring example project

This repo contains several Spring Boot example projects to demonstrate various features available in
the Spring ecosystem in a purposefully opinionated way to help showcase best practices. Each example
microservice is a separate subproject in the `spring-apps` directory, which is the root project of
the gradle build.

These projects can also be used as components to test drive other things, such as CICD pipelines /
Github workflows, monitoring, etc.
