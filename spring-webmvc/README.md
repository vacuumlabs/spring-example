# Spring-webmvc example

This application is a simple Spring Boot application, serving as example with a single REST API
and telemetry - `logback` logging, `Micrometer` metrics and `Micrometer+OpenTelemetry` tracing.

More about the telemetry setup can be found in the
[telemetry/README](src%2Fmain%2Fkotlin%2Fcom%2Fvacuumlabs%2Fexample%2Ftelemetry%2FREADME.md).
